## About the App

<!-- ![Movie App Preview](https://images2.imgbox.com/dc/50/sruZZQsy_o.png) -->

The app is a gallery showcasing different images to a signed in user. The app has some cool features that are detailed as follows:

- **`Sign In`**: On page load, there is a restriction to unauthorised users to sign in before engaging with the app;
- **`Drag-And-Drop`**: A drag and drop functionality for the authenticated user to update the positions on the different images in the gallery;
- **`Search using 'tags'`**: After the user is signed in, the app allows the user to search through the image catalog using tags on the images or typing in theri own search key to filter through the image gallery;
- **`Sign Out`**: On signing out, the user gets redirected to the Sign In page because they are denied access to the gallery page.
