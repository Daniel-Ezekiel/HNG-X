- A search feature to find a movie of choice and results get displayed in the featured movies section;
- In the featured movies section, a grid of cards that shows 10 most popular movies is displayed with basic info like the title, release date and ratings;
- On selecting a movie card, you get redirected to another page that shows more info about the selected movie like the poster image, title, runtime and release date.
